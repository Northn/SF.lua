# SF.lua
<p align="center"><img src="/logo.png" height="250px" /></p>

SF.lua is library for [MoonLoader](https://www.blast.hk/moonloader), which provides an opportunity to interact with SA-MP. This library doesn't replace all [SAMPFUNCS](https://www.blast.hk/sampfuncs), it just adds new functions for Lua script.

## Progress
At the moment, SF.lua is done at 78%, of this left:
* Events onSendRpc/onSendPacket/etc;
* Functions with sending RPC/Packet;
* Custom handler of commands.

## Functional
There will be no functions in SF.lua:
* Associated with the creation/editing of custom windows DXUT;
* Interaction with SAMPFUNCS/CLEO.

There are also new features for easy interaction.
