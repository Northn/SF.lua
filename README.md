# SF.lua
<p align="center"><img src="/logo.png" height="250px" /></p>

SF.lua is library for [MoonLoader](https://www.blast.hk/moonloader), which provides an opportunity to interact with SA-MP. This library doesn't replace all [SAMPFUNCS](https://www.blast.hk/sampfuncs), it just adds new functions for Lua script.  
Version: v0.78.7-alpha.

## Progress
At the moment, SF.lua is done at 78%, of this left:
* Events onSendRpc/onSendPacket/etc;
* Functions with sending RPC/Packet;
* Custom handler of commands.

## Functional
Supporting versions of SA-MP: [0.3.7-R1](https://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=572700). There are also new features for easy interaction.  
There will be no functions in SF.lua:
* Associated with the creation/editing of custom windows DXUT;
* Interaction with SAMPFUNCS/CLEO.
